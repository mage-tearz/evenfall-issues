# evenfall-issues
This is the official bug reports page for Evenfall - Outlands-RP.

## Reporting Bugs
When writing a bug report, include the following information:

- Explain expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
- Relevant screenshots / video demonstrating the issue.
- An UNCROPPED screenshot of your Problems Menu, clearly showing all Lua script errors, even if none appear.
- An UNCROPPED screenhot of your developer console.

If any of the information above is missing in one of your reports, it's most likely that we'll discard your report and prevent you from posting further. Got it? Good.

If there is already an existing report for the issue you posted, yours will be closed and redirected to the existing post.

If you posted the issue, the chances are we can probably see it too. You don't need to tell us that it exists.

If we ask you to provide more information, do your best to provide it.

This is not a suggestions page. Redirect yourself to the Discord forum.
